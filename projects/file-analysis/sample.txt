It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.  
The streets were empty, the shops were closed, and the only sound was the wind whistling through the alleys.  

Maria walked slowly, carrying a small notebook in her hand.  
She often wrote her thoughts down so she would not forget them later.  
Writing was her way of making sense of the world.  

Sometimes the words came easily, like water flowing from a stream.  
Other times she stared at the blank page, waiting for inspiration to arrive.  
But no matter how difficult, she always returned to her notebook.  

To Maria, words were more than ink on paper â€”  
they were memories, feelings, and pieces of her soul carefully captured in lines.
